# Project_Puzzle

Puzzler is a mobile Google Cardboard VR experience primarily designed for newbies in VR to experience the mechanics of VR through a simple Simon-says type puzzle game. Players enter a spooky, dimly-lit dungeon, only to find that the only way to escape is through following the given instructions in-game and matching the correct orb sequence.
